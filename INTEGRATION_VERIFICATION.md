# GetReceipts Integration Verification

## ✅ Implementation Completed

**Integration method used**: Option 1: Minimal Integration (Enhanced)

**Function modified**: `process()` in `src/knowledge_system/commands/process.py`

**Files changed**: 
- `src/knowledge_system/commands/process.py` - Added GetReceipts integration call when `--export-getreceipts` flag is used
- Used existing `knowledge_chipper_integration.py` integration function

## 📝 Sample Data Formats

**Your people data format**:
```python
# HCE Input Format (what Knowledge Chipper produces):
{
  "normalized": "Dr. Sarah Chen",
  "surface": "Dr. Sarah Chen", 
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "entity_type": "person"
}

# Converted to GetReceipts Format:
{
  "name": "Dr. Sarah Chen",
  "bio": None,  # HCE doesn't provide bio
  "expertise": None,  # HCE doesn't provide expertise  
  "credibility_score": 0.85,
  "sources": []  # HCE doesn't provide sources
}
```

**Your jargon data format**:
```python
# HCE Input Format:
{
  "term": "overfitting",
  "definition": "A modeling error when ML models memorize training data rather than learning patterns",
  "category": "machine learning"
}

# Converted to GetReceipts Format:
{
  "term": "overfitting",
  "definition": "A modeling error when ML models memorize training data rather than learning patterns",
  "domain": "machine learning",
  "related_terms": [],
  "examples": []
}
```

**Your mental models data format**:
```python
# HCE Input Format:
{
  "name": "Bias-Variance Tradeoff",
  "definition": "The fundamental tradeoff between model complexity and generalization",
  "aliases": ["bias", "variance", "overfitting", "underfitting"]
}

# Converted to GetReceipts Format:
{
  "name": "Bias-Variance Tradeoff", 
  "description": "The fundamental tradeoff between model complexity and generalization",
  "domain": None,  # HCE doesn't provide domain
  "key_concepts": ["bias", "variance", "overfitting", "underfitting"],
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "high complexity", "to": "overfitting", "type": "causes"},
    {"from": "overfitting", "to": "poor generalization", "type": "causes"}
  ]
}
```

## ❗ Issues Encountered

**None** - The integration was successfully implemented with no major issues.

**Key Implementation Details**:
1. **HCE Data Conversion**: Successfully mapped HCE data structures (ScoredClaim, PersonMention, JargonTerm, MentalModel) to GetReceipts format
2. **Claim Filtering**: Only exports high-quality claims (tier A and B) from HCE to GetReceipts
3. **Path Handling**: Properly imports the integration function from project root
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for graceful failure handling
5. **CLI Integration**: Uses existing `--export-getreceipts` flag in the process command

## 🔧 Integration Architecture

**How it works**:
1. User runs: `knowledge-system process video.mp4 --output ./results --export-getreceipts`
2. Knowledge Chipper processes the video through HCE (Human Computer Engine)
3. HCE extracts claims, people, jargon, and mental models
4. Our integration converts HCE format to GetReceipts format
5. Calls `publish_to_getreceipts()` function with converted data
6. GetReceipts API receives and stores the claims with knowledge artifacts
7. Returns URLs for viewing the published claims

**Command to test full pipeline**:
```bash
knowledge-system process your_video.mp4 --output ./results --export-getreceipts
```
